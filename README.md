# LiveChat
A very simplistic messaging app that showcases how to create collaborative apps with the [Realm Mobile Platform](https://realm.io/products/realm-mobile-platform/).

It was demoed at a Xamarin University guest lecture (link TBD).

## Prerequisites
- An ROS instance: https://realm.io/docs/get-started/installation/mac/.
- Xamarin Studio/Visual Studio with the Xamarin features installed.

## Running the sample

The sample should download all dependencies automatically.

## Using the app

- You must first login with an admin Realm user - you can create users from the Dashboard.
- You create a "room" that other users can join to by giving it a name and pressing the `Create` button.
- Once a room has been created anyone can join (provided they know its name) and start chatting.
- Messages will appear to other users in green as they are being written and in white after pressing `Send`.
